# ROS_mini_project
Directing a turtlebot using Laser scan reading in a defined obstacle environment.

![](IMAGES/MiniProjectBachelorBurger.png)



The turtlebot is given a defined environment, where it has to make a way through the obstacle infront.


The turtlebot has a built-in laser sensor that will give the distances to the nearest obstacles surrounding it

**Task:** 

Turtlebot has to find the opening in the door and has to drive towards the wall, make a turn and drive along it without colliding.

Then when free space is seen on left or right side (depending on the rotation direction that you chose earlier) turn again about ~90Â° and move further into the x direction into infinity. 

**outcomes:**

To brush up ROS basics, 

To manipulate LaserScan message from /scan topic.

Language used is python.
